# My Portfolio

## Description
This is my working portfolio for the challenge of Module 2. This will be the main hub where I can put all of my projects that I work on over the course of this Bootcamp, but also anyting that I will want to display for anyone who finds it. This project was something that I built from scratch, and something that I am pretty proud of. Motivation for this project was really getting it visual appealing and responsive on all forms of devices to make it easily acceptable for anyone to read. By doing this project I learned a lot about how to style specific elements within an HTML page.
